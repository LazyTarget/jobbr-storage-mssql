This is a storage adapter implementation for the [Jobbr .NET JobServer](http://www.jobbr.io) to store job related information on MS SQL Servers. 
The Jobbr main repository can be found on [JobbrIO/jobbr-server](https://github.com/jobbrIO).

## Installation
First of all you'll need a working jobserver by using the usual builder as shown in the demos ([jobbrIO/jobbr-demo](https://github.com/jobbrIO/jobbr-demo)). In addition to that you'll need to install the NuGet Package for this extension.

### NuGet

    Install-Package Jobbr.Storage.MsSql

### Configuration
Since you already have a configured server, the registration of the MsSQL Storage Provider is quite easy. Actually you only need a working Database-Connection (A list of typical ConnectionStrings can be found on [https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/](https://www.connectionstrings.com/sql-server/)

```c#
using Jobbr.Storage.MsSql;

/* ... */

var builder = new JobbrBuilder();

builder.AddMsSqlStorage(config =>
{
    // Your connection string
    config.ConnectionString = @"Server=.\SQLEXPRESS;Integrated Security=true;InitialCatalog=JobbrDemoTest;";

    // Default schema is "Jobbr", change if you want
    config.Schema = "Own";

    // Configure your SqlDialect
    configuration.DialectProvider = ServiceStack.OrmLite.SqlServerDialect.Provider;
});

server.Start();
```

### Database-Schema
The extensions assumes that there are already all related tables in the referenced database. Please make sure that these tables are created by using the script located on [source/Jobbr.Storage.MsSql/CreateSchemaAndTables.sql](source/Jobbr.Storage.MsSql/CreateSchemaAndTables.sql).
